## Features


## Design

### Color Scheme

![Color Pallete](assets/documentations/color-pallete.png)
![Color numbers](assets/documentations/colors.png)

This colour pallete has been used as it is very calming and easy on the eye. Green and the shades of green have many psychological benefits. I used it specifically as it goes incredibly well with the purpose of the website. Green is a symbolical colour for GO and Passing and accomplishment that's why. I used it here as the whole purpose is to realign users lifes. By getting them to show up everyday to achieve small habits and improve drastically over time. 1% improvement a day is a 365% improvement by the end of the year.

### Typography
